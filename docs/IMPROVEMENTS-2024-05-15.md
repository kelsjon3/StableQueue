# StableQueue Improvements (May 15, 2024)

## Overview

This document outlines significant improvements made to the StableQueue application on May 15, 2024, focusing on fixing several critical issues:

1. Socket.io connection instability
2. Progress image preview display in UI
3. Error handling and job recovery
4. Caching and performance
5. Image file path normalization

## 1. Socket.io Connection Stability

### Issues Addressed
- Intermittent disconnections during job processing
- WebSocket connections failing to properly reconnect
- Browser tab changes causing missed updates

### Solutions Implemented
- Added proper reconnection logic with configurable retry limits
- Implemented initial state synchronization upon reconnection
- Enhanced client-side event handling to handle reconnections gracefully
- Added server-side tracking of client connections for better reliability

## 2. Progress Image Preview

### Issues Addressed
- Preview images not displaying correctly during generation
- Stale images showing from previous generations
- Preview updates appearing out of order

### Solutions Implemented
- Added cache-busting query parameters to preview image URLs
- Implemented proper image loading/error handling in the UI
- Enhanced the progress update event structure to include image metadata
- Created a separate dedicated channel for image preview updates

## 3. Error Handling and Job Recovery

### Issues Addressed
- Failed jobs not properly marked as such in the database
- Error states not propagating correctly to the UI
- Jobs getting "stuck" in processing state

### Solutions Implemented
- Added comprehensive error detection and propagation
- Implemented automatic job recovery for zombie processing jobs
- Enhanced logging for easier debugging of failed jobs
- Added retry mechanisms with configurable retry limits

## 4. Message Flow Documentation

Enhanced the documentation of message flow between components:

- `[FORGE→SERVER]`: Events and data coming from Forge to StableQueue
- `[SERVER→CLIENT]`: Updates sent from StableQueue to browser clients

Key event flow improvements:
```
[FORGE→SERVER] generate_status
  → [SERVER] Processes status update
    → [SERVER→CLIENT] job_progress (WebSocket event with progress data)
      → [CLIENT] Updates UI with progress, including preview image
```

## 5. Image Path Normalization

### Issues Addressed
- Inconsistent path separators causing image lookup failures
- Path resolution issues between Windows and Linux systems
- Relative path handling causing confusion

### Solutions Implemented
- Created a dedicated path normalization utility
- Standardized all path handling to use forward slashes
- Enhanced path joining to handle both absolute and relative paths correctly
- Implemented a more robust system for resolving checkpoint paths

## 6. Performance Optimization

### Issues Addressed
- Slow response times for jobs with large image data
- Memory usage growing during high-volume operations
- Excessive database queries during status polling

### Solutions Implemented
- Added database query optimization with proper indexing
- Implemented caching for frequently accessed data
- Reduced redundant processing of image data
- Enhanced job queue processing to handle large volumes more efficiently
- Optimized WebSocket payloads to reduce unnecessary data transfer

## Conclusion

These improvements provide a more robust foundation for the StableQueue application, delivering a better user experience with more accurate progress reporting and proper image handling.

Next steps include implementing the extension API for broader integration capabilities and enhancing the UI for better job management.
