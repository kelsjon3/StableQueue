# StableQueue Deployment Status

## Current Deployment

**Server**: Unraid at 192.168.73.124:8083  
**Status**: ✅ Active and Operational  
**Last Updated**: January 2025  

## Recent Fixes Applied

### Issue Resolution
The application experienced startup issues after over-engineering "first-time setup" complexity. The following fixes have been deployed:

### 1. Simplified API Key Management
- **Problem**: Over-complicated "first-time setup" logic with special endpoints
- **Solution**: Removed setup complexity, standard API key creation works consistently
- **Result**: Creating 1st API key works exactly like creating 100th API key

### 2. Fixed Import Issues
- **Problem**: Incorrect import in `routes/apiKeys.js` breaking container startup
- **Solution**: Fixed destructured import for `corsMiddleware`
- **Result**: Container starts successfully

### 3. Corrected Function Parameters
- **Problem**: `createApiKey` function called with wrong parameter order
- **Solution**: Fixed parameter mapping in API key creation route
- **Result**: API key creation works properly

### 4. Enhanced Authentication Support
- **Problem**: Authentication middleware only supported X-API-Key/X-API-Secret format
- **Solution**: Added support for both header formats (X-API-Key/Secret and Authorization Bearer)
- **Result**: Backward compatibility maintained, extension flexibility improved

## Application Flow (Simplified)

1. **Application starts** - Works immediately ✅
2. **Add servers** - Connect to Stable Diffusion instances as needed ✅
3. **Generate API keys** - Create them when needed for external applications ✅
4. **Manage jobs** - Queue, monitor, view results ✅
5. **View images** - See generated content in frontend gallery ✅

## Testing Status

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Server connectivity (192.168.73.124:8083)
- ✅ API key creation via curl
- ✅ Authentication with both header formats
- ✅ Single job submission
- ⚠️ Bulk job submission (requires container restart for new endpoint)
- ⚠️ Extension settings visibility in Forge

### API Key Management
- ✅ Web UI administrative access (no auth required)
- ✅ Standard CRUD operations
- ✅ Consistent behavior for all operations
- ✅ No special "setup" endpoints needed

## Known Working Configuration

**API Credentials**:
- API Key: `mk_1f37ad25b30674500a9d8c3e`
- API Secret: `dc82a5d88ed78460eebfc13f8f21226e`

**Server Detection**:
- Found 2 servers: Laptop, ArchLinux

**Successful Job Example**:
- Job ID: `3eb6d3d7-b84d-4da7-97f9-59793cd5173f`
- Status: Completed successfully

## Architecture

**Backend**: Node.js/Express with SQLite database  
**Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
**Deployment**: Single Docker container  
**Authentication**: Dual header format support for external apps  
**Web UI**: Administrative access without API key requirements  

## Next Steps

1. **Container Restart**: Required to pick up bulk endpoint for v2 API
2. **Extension Debug**: Investigate Forge settings visibility issue
3. **Documentation**: Updated to reflect simplified approach
4. **Monitoring**: Verify continued stable operation

## Documentation Updated

- ✅ README.md - Simplified application flow
- ✅ API_KEY_UI_SUMMARY.md - Removed setup complexity
- ✅ API.md - Clarified authentication approaches
- ✅ PLAN.md - Updated core philosophy

## Deployment Method

Current deployment uses the automated script:
```bash
./deploy-stablequeue-to-unraid.sh
```

This script:
1. Builds Docker image locally
2. Saves and transfers to Unraid server
3. Loads and restarts container
4. Preserves data volumes and configuration
